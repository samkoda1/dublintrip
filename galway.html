                <p>Today we took a trip to the coastal city Galway! We left StayCity at around 9AM and the bus ride took about two hours. I got on the bus and instantly fell asleep because I was so tired. Once we got there we dropped our stuff off at the hotel and walked around for a little. Since I was cold in short sleeves and shorts, I decided to go buy a sweatshirt at the mall that was next to our hotel. After I bought the sweatshirt I decided to get a sausage which you can see on the Nommies page. After our free time we took a trip to the <a href="https://ccmireland.com/" target="_blank">Computer and Communications Museum of Ireland</a>. I really liked playing all the old games like Pac-man and Street Fighter. I also enjoyed learning about the history of the technology. I especially liked the demonstration of the telegraph. </p>
