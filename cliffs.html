                <p>Today we took a trip to the beautiful Cliffs of Moher. The departure time was at 9AM. An hour into our journey we took a stop at a castle. We walked around the castle for a few minutes then got back on the bus and continued our ride. The roadside scenery was absolutely stunning. My roommate Ben captured the amazing landscape in a photo of me sleeping on the bus. We finally got there and I decided to have wings and chips at the visitor center where they served food. Unfortunately, I was so hungry that I did not get a photo of the meal to put on my Nommies page. After I finished eating I embarked on a walking journey along the cliffs. The view was stunning and made me emotional. Professor Colleen saw me and she got some great photos of me by the edge of the cliff. I'm so glad it was a beautiful day at the cliffs. The view was truly enhanced by the sunny weather. Once it was time to go I got on the bus and fell asleep because I was so tired from hiking along the cliffs. We arrived back at the hotel around 6PM. I got dinner then I went to sleep so I could rest for the Trinity tour. </p>
