        <h3>Sam's First Day</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 8, 2024</time>
        <p>On my first whole day in Dublin we had orientation at Griffith College where we will be attending class for the next few weeks. After orientation we were given time to go explore and eat lucnh. I ate lunch at the <a href="https://thefumbally.ie/" target="_blank">Fumbally</a> where I had a steak sandwich. It was bussin. After that we met up and did a bus tour of Dublin. It was very informative and I learned a lot. My favorite stop was when we saw the <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/arbour-hill-dublin-1916-easter-rising#:~:text=Quicklime%20Graves%20at%20Arbour%20Hill,British%20barracks%20and%20military%20prison." target="_blank">rebel burial grounds</a> . After the tour we were done for the day. We got back to the apartments and I took a nap then got dinner with my roommmate Ben. Then I went to bed early to get up for class the next day.</p>

        <h3>Sam's Second and Third Day</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024</time>
        <p>Our second day was also our first day of class. In class we set up our GitHub repository and copied the example website. We then started to tailor the example website to our own unique style. We will continue to work at this as we learn more and more skills to style our website. After class we were given the rest of the afternoon to do as we wanted. I had fun going on a run and exploring some of Dublin. After my run I went to dinner with some classmates at <a href="https://wowburger.ie" target="_blank">Wowburger</a>. It was delicious! After dinner I went home and relaxed till I went to bed.</p>
        <p>On the third day we learned about implenting a couple things into our website such as, media queries for accessibility and responsiveness, grids for photo galleries, and flex for navigation. After class I went back to the hotel and ate lunch and relaxed while I waited till 3 for our guest lecturers that spoke about gamification and a library website. Once that concluded, some classmates and I went to dinner at a place called <a href="https://theramenbar.ie/" target="_blank">the Ramen Bar</a>. As we were walking there I looked at Saint Patrick's Catherdral. Once we got there, I ordered tonkotsu ramen and I thought it was very good. After that I went back to the room and fell asleep because I was very fatigued. </p>
