        <h2>Sam's Travel Day and First Full day</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 8, 2024</time>
        <p>The day began with me waking up early to finish packing for my trip. Once I finished packing it was time to drive two hours to Philly for my direct flight to Dublin. The flight was about 6 hours long and I arrived around 6:00 AM. My pickup time was around 9:00 AM so I had to hang around the airport for a little. Once we got everyone together at the airport we all piled into a van and went to lunch. I ordered a traditional Irish Burger with fries. It was a very good meal especially since I was so hungry from traveling. After the meal we went to our apartments where we will be staying for the next 2 and a half weeks. There, I met my roommate Ben, who seemed very nice. I can't wait for all the adventures I'm going to have! </p>
        <p>On my first whole day in Dublin we had orientation at Griffith College where we will be attending class for the next few weeks. After orientation we were given time to go explore and eat lucnh. I ate lunch at the <a href="https://thefumbally.ie/" target="_blank">Fumbally</a> where I had a steak sandwich. It was bussin. After that we met up and did a bus tour of Dublin. It was very informative and I learned a lot. My favorite stop was when we saw the <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/arbour-hill-dublin-1916-easter-rising#:~:text=Quicklime%20Graves%20at%20Arbour%20Hill,British%20barracks%20and%20military%20prison." target="_blank">rebel burial grounds</a> . After the tour we were done for the day. We got back to the apartments and I took a nap then got dinner with my roommmate Ben. Then I went to bed early to get up for class the next day.</p>

        <h2>Sam's Second and Third Day</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024</time>
        <p>Our second day was also our first day of class. In class we set up our GitHub repository and copied the example website. We then started to tailor the example website to our own unique style. We will continue to work at this as we learn more and more skills to style our website. After class we were given the rest of the afternoon to do as we wanted. I had fun going on a run and exploring some of Dublin. After my run I went to dinner with some classmates at <a href="https://wowburger.ie" target="_blank">Wowburger</a>. It was delicious! After dinner I went home and relaxed till I went to bed.</p>
        <p>On the third day we learned about implenting a couple things into our website such as, media queries for accessibility and responsiveness, grids for photo galleries, and flex for navigation. After class I went back to the hotel and ate lunch and relaxed while I waited till 3 for our guest lecturers that spoke about gamification and a library website. Once that concluded, some classmates and I went to dinner at a place called <a href="https://theramenbar.ie/" target="_blank">the Ramen Bar</a>. As we were walking there I looked at Saint Patrick's Catherdral. Once we got there, I ordered tonkotsu ramen and I thought it was very good. After that I went back to the room and fell asleep because I was very fatigued. </p>

        <h2>Sam's Fourth Day</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-05-10">May 10, 2024</time>
        <p>Today we visited the a <a href="https://epicchq.com/?utm_source=adwords&utm_term=dublin%20epic%20museum&utm_campaign=Google+Search+-+Brand+-+2019&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_tgt=kwd-456825863017&hsa_src=g&hsa_kw=dublin%20epic%20museum&hsa_ver=3&hsa_mt=e&hsa_cam=12972805156&hsa_ad=532247952191&hsa_grp=121979769756&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_acc=1298776736&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwupGyBhBBEiwA0UcqaOiUV4SgLGtjAKxxOtb9xgXOWX6vXKiqvgrWaRu1oIEcC8pSwc9AXhoCVncQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum.</a> I thought the Museum was very interesting. It touched on topics throughout Ireland's history such as immigration, sports history, invention, and heritage. I enjoyed going around and stamping my paper passport at each room. I learned a great many things. One thing I thought was really interesting was Gaelic Football. In Gaelic Football players advance the ball by carrying, kicking, bouncing, hand-passing, and soloing. The sport has a lot of things that are similar to others sports, but they are all incorporated together into one single sport which is very interesting to me. I also liked the gift shop where the had coasters and key chains with the last name of Irish families. I found a keychain that had the last name Conroy on it which was my grandmothers last name before she married my grandfather.</p>
        <p>After we finished with the museum my roommate and I walked around Dublin for a little. We visited various shops such as a <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-ie/stores/store/dublin" target="_blank">lego shop</a> and a gift shop. At the gift shop there was a doll that was kind of scary. I'm glad we got the chance to walk back from the museum because I got to take a picture on one of the bridges we were walking on. The picture I took was primarily of the Liffey, but it also captures some of Dublin in the background. </p>

        <h2>Sam's Fifth Day</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-05-11">May 11, 2024</time>
        <p>Today we took our first day trip. Our first stop was to Glendalough. I think my overall experience at Glendalough was enhanced becuase of the amazing weather. I liked Glendalough because it had a lot of history and it was very beautiful. Glendalough has a lot of people buried there so it was interesting to read a lot of the tombstones. Some of the tombstones had stories of the people that were buried there which I thought was very cool. I especially enjoyed the view from the second lake that we visted. The valley that we were in was such a treat that I was not expecting to see while on this trip. There were also a lot of deer and dogs hanging out around the lake which I enjoyed. </p>
        <p>Later that day we drove to Kilkenny. Since we had some free time before our tour of Kilkenny castle, I decided to run up to Saint Mary's Cathedral. I love looking at cathedrals because I am very interested in the architecture. I'm glad that I made the walk to visit the Cathedral because it was very pretty on the inside and on the outside. After that we toured Kilkenny castle which had a lot of historic furniture and artwork in it. Once, I had finished walking through the castle I went outside and was astonished at the rolling parkland which spands for approximately 50 acres.</p>
